    Any style guide written in English is either so brief that itâ€™s ambiguous,
    or so long that no one reads it.

  @p
    @lnk("Scalafmt", repo) turns the mess on the left into the (hopefully)
    readable, idiomatic and consistent Scala code on the right.

  @demo
    object FormatMe { List(number) match { case head :: Nil if head % 2 == 0 => "number is even"
      case head :: Nil => "number is not even"
      case Nil => "List is empty" }
      function(arg1, arg2(arg3(arg4, arg5, "arg6"), arg7 + arg8), arg9.select(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) }

  @p
    @lnk("Scalafmt", repo) is an opinionated code formatter.
    The default style should work great out of the box so you can focus on
    writing correct, maintainable and fast code.
    Mark the end of dreadful arguments on formatting!

  @p
    Scalafmt is very new.
    Still, scalafmt is already useful for me so it might also be useful for you.
    Scalafmt can format all of Spark, Akka, Scala.js and the IntelliJ Scala plugin.
    It's quite fast, too.
    Over 95% of all files format in under under 160ms on my laptop.

  @sect{Installation}

    @sect{IntelliJ}
      @lnk("Here is the plugin", "https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8236?pr=").
      You can install it directly from within IntelliJ,
      @ul
        @li
          open @code("Settings > Plugins")
        @li
          open @code("Browse repositories")
        @li
          search for @code("scalafmt")
        @li
          restart IntelliJ.

      @p
        The default shortcut is @code("Ctrl + Shift + L").
        Undo works, but not redo.

      @p
        The plugin picks up custom style configuration from the file @code(".scalafmt")
        if it exists in the root directory of your project or your home directory.
        For details, see @sect.ref{Configuration}.

    @sect{SBT}
      @hl.scala
        addSbtPlugin("com.geirsson" % "sbt-scalafmt" % "@org.scalafmt.Versions.stable")

      @ul
        @li
          @lnk("Here is an example repository using sbt plugin.",
               "https://github.com/olafurpg/sbt-scalafmt-example")
        @li
          Run @code("sbt scalafmt") to format all files in the project.
        @li
          Run @code("sbt scalafmtTest") to test whether all files are are
          properly formatted. An exception is thrown in case of failure, no
          files are formatted.
        @li
          Set @code("scalafmtConfig := Some(file(\".scalafmt\"))") to let the
          plugin pick up custom style configurations from @code(".scalafmt")
          in the root directory of your project.
          For details, see @sect.ref{Configuration}.
        @li
          Add @code("reformatOnCompileSettings") to you build settings to
          enable automatically formatting files on compile.
          @b("WARNING"). Formatting a large file (~4.000 LOC) can take up
          to 1-2s, so it might be undesirable to let scalafmt delay compilation.
        @li
          In case of any trouble, try to run @code("reload") and @code("clean").
        @li
          If you have a multi-project build and the custom @code(".scalafmt") configuration is
          not picked up, make sure that @code("scalafmtConfig") is defined for
          all of your projects, not only the root project.
          Use @code("show scalafmtConfig") to verify that
          @code("scalafmtConfig := Some(file(.scalafmt))")
          in all of your projects.

    @sect{CLI}
      There are several ways to install the CLI.

      @sect{Build from source}
        For the greatest performance and prettiest output.

        @ul
          @li
            Clone the @lnk("repo", repo).
          @li
            Run @code("sbt assembly"), master branch should pass tests.
          @li
            @code("cli/target/scala-2.11/scalafmt.jar") should exist.
          @li
            follow instructions in @sect.ref{scalafmt.jar}.


      @sect{scalafmt.jar}

        You can also download a pre-compiled jar from the
        @lnk("releases page", repo + "/releases").

        Next, create a script named @code("scalafmt") somewhere in your
        @code("PATH") with the command:

        @hl.scala
          java -jar PATH_TO/scalafmt.jar $@@


      @sect{Homebrew/OSX}
        @hl.scala
          brew tap olafurpg/scalafmt
          brew install scalafmt
          scalafmt --version // should be @org.scalafmt.Versions.stable

      @sect{Usage examples}

        Please refer to the @code("--help") page.

        @hl.scala(org.scalafmt.cli.Cli.parser.usage)

    @sect{Vim}
      @ul
        @li
          Make sure you have the @sect.ref{CLI} installed and working.
        @li
          install @lnk("vim-autoformat", "https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat")
        @li
          add to your @code(".vimrc")
          @hl.scala
            noremap <F5> :Autoformat<CR>
            let g:formatdef_scalafmt = "'scalafmt'"
            let g:formatters_scala = ['scalafmt']

      @note. You pay the JVM startup penalty on every format.

    @sect{Standalone library}
      Add to your dependencies
      @hl.scala
        libraryDependencies += "com.geirsson" %% "scalafmt" % "@org.scalafmt.Versions.stable"
      @p
        Use the API like this

      @repl
        org.scalafmt.Scalafmt.format("""
        object FormatMe { List(Split(Space, 0).withPolicy(SingleLineBlock(close)), Split(Newline, 1).withPolicy{ case Decision(t@@FormatToken(_, `close`, _), s) => Decision(t, List(Split(Newline, 0)))}.withIndent(2, close, Right)) }
         """).get

  @sect{Code examples}
    @p
      @note. The rules are still evolving. Feel free to discuss about them in
      the gitter channel. To start with, I implemented a default style that I
      like myself.

    @p
      The plan is to later add support for few official coding styles that have
      proven to work for large codebases and scale to at least a few dozens
      of contributors. For example, from
      @lnk("Scala.js", "https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/CODINGSTYLE.md") and
      @lnk("Spark", "https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Spark+Code+Style+Guide").

    @sect{Function application}

      @example
        // 40 columns                          |
        object FunctionApplication {
          // 1. Fits on a single line
          function(arg1, arg2, arg3)

          // 2. Fits on a single line, with newline indented by 4
          function(longerArg1, longerArg2, arg3)

          // 3. One line for each argument, indented at (
          function(longerArg1, longerArg2, longerArg3)

          // 4. One line for each argument, indented at 4
          function(superDuperLongArg(
              evenHasNestedArgs, notOnlyOneButTwo), // This arg is too long.
              arg2IsNotAsBad)

          // 5. (opt-in) "Config style", put newline after opening (
          // and newline before closing ) to force one argument
          // on each line indented by 4. Overrides other options.
          function(
              longerArg1 = defaultValue1, longerArg2 = defaultValue2, longerArg3 = defaultValue3
              ) // Closing ) gets a newline
        }

      These rules are re-used in the following contexts:
      @ul
        @li
          Curried functions. Rules are applied on each individual pair of
          parentheses independently from each other.
        @li
          Function declaration. No difference, default values
           are treated like named argument.
        @li
          Type application. Same rules, except for brackets @code("[]") instead
          of parentheses.

    @sect{Select chains}

      @example
        // 40 columns                          |
        object SelectChains {
          // 1. Fits on a single line
          List(1).map(_ + 1).filter(_ == 2)

          // 2. Force newline at each dot, with indent 2.
          List(1, 2, 3, 4)
            .map(_ + 1)
            .filter(_ % 2 == 0)
        }

    @sect{Pattern matching}

      @example
        // 40 columns                          |
        object PatternMatching {
          List(1, 2, 3) match {
            // if indented by 2, for separation from the case body.
            case 1 :: tail if tail.length == 2 => "1 is head"
            // if put on separate line, if condition doesn't fit on single line
            case lst if lst.length == 2 && lst.head == 1 => "lst has lenght 3"
          }
        }

    @sect{Token alignment}

      The style @code("defaultWithAlign") will align various related tokens.

      @exampleAlign
        // 40 columns                          |
        object TokenAlignment {
          x match {
            // Align by => and -> and //
            case 1 => 1 -> 2 // first
            case 11 => 11 -> 22 // second

            // A blank line separates alignment blocks.
            case `ignoreMe` => 111 -> 222
          }

          // Align assignments of similar type.
          def name = column[String]("name")
          def status = column[Int]("status")
          val x = 1
          val xx = 22

          // Align sbt module IDs.
          libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
            "org.scala-lang" % "scala-compiler" % scalaVersion.value,
            "com.lihaoyi" %% "sourcecode" % "0.1.1"
          )
        }
    @sect{stripMargin alignment}
      @p
        Off by default, enable with

        @cliFlags
          --assumeStandardLibraryStripMargin true
      @p
        @note. May cause non-idempotent formatting in rare cases, see @issue(192).

      @p
        The margin character @code("|") is aligned with the opening triple
        quote @code("\"\"\"") in interpolated and raw string literals.

        @example(org.scalafmt.util.FileOps.readFile("readme/stripMargin.example"),
                 stripMarginStyle)

    @sect{// format: off}
      Disable formatting for specific regions of code by wrapping them in
      @code("// format: OFF") blocks:

      @example(org.scalafmt.util.FileOps.readFile("readme/matrix.example"))

      To disable formatting for a whole file, put the first comment
      at the top of the file.

      @ul
        @li
          the comment string is not case sensitive, so you can also write
          @code("// format: OFF").
        @li
          The comments @code("// @formatter:off") and @code("// @formatter:off")
          will also work, for compatibility with the IntelliJ formatter.
        @li
          Scalafmt will do it's best to resume formatting at the correct
          indentation level. It's best to enable it at the same level as
          when it was disabled.

  @sect{Configuration}

    @p
      There are two ways to configure @code("scalafmt").

      @ol
        @li
          As Scala code via the @code("ScalafmtConfig") case class.
          This is handy when using scalafmt as a standalone library.
          For details, refer to the Scaladoc.
        @li
          (experimental) In a plain text file, options are defined as CLI flags.
          I recommend you create a file named @code(".scalafmt") and keep it in
          the root directory of your project.

          @p
            Here is an example @code(".scalafmt").

            @cliFlags
              # Example .scalafmt, comments are supported.
              --style defaultWithAlign # For pretty alignment.
              --maxColumn 100 # For my wide 30" display.

            To experiment with different options, I recommend you use the CLI.
            For details, read about the @code("--config") flag in the
            @code("--help") page of the CLI.

          @p
            Consult the section on your

      @note. Configuration options for scalafmt are still very few.

  @sect{FAQ / Troubleshooting}

     @sect{How can I be notified of releases/annoucements?}
       Join @lnk("the scalafmt mailing list", "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalafmt")
       to receive announcements of new releases only. No spam, promise.

     @sect{How do I customize scalafmt?}
       See @sect.ref{Configuration}.

     @sect{Why not Scalariform?}
       @lnk("Scalariform", "http://scala-ide.org/scalariform/") does an
       excellent job of tidying up common formatting errors. However,

       @ul
         @li
           Scalariform does not support enforcing column-width limits, which
           I personally like and is present in many popular coding styles.
         @li
           In my experience, Scalariform gives makes it easy to write sloppy
           looking code after a few rounds of refactoring. Scalafmt is
           more opinionated, and takes a lot more liberty to add/remove
           newlines.
         @li
           Scalariform cannot format @lnk("Dotty", "https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty") code,
           which has minor syntactic differences to Scala. Being built with scala.meta,
           scalafmt is ready to support dotty.
         @li
           The original Scalariform author stopped maintaining the library a
           few years ago.

       Finally, scalafmt is my Master's thesis project. I thought it would
       be a fun challenge to write a code formatter :)

     @sect{Why is scalafmt so slow?}
       @p
         My benchmarks show that scalafmt is for most common cases around 4-6x
         slower than scalariform (btw, scalariform is already impressively fast).
         This means that formatting your average 1.000 LOC file on modern
         hardware will take around 200ms, which should still feel close enough
         to instant.

       @p
         The main feature that makes scalafmt slower than scalariform is the
         column-width limit.
         To figure the "best" way to break a long line, Scalafmt may try
         thousands of different formatting solutions.

       @p
         Performance is still a work in progress and will hopefully
         continue to improve in future releases. Help here is appreciated.

     @sect{scalafmt creates huge diffs!}
       I understand that some rules may trigger unnecessarily large diffs in pull
       requests. I still believe it's worth it, considering

       @ol
         @li
           Proper formatting @lnk("helps you catch bugs", "https://twitter.com/extempore2/status/717716747181096960")!
         @li
           you can enable non-whitespace diffs during code review. For Github,
           add @code("?w=1") to the URL and the diff ignores whitespace changes.
         @li
           code is read more often outside of pull requests.

     @sect{Is the formatting output stable between releases?}
       No, the formatting rules will evolve even between PATCH releases.
       I recommend you add a commit formatting your whole project for every time
       scalafmt update.

  @sect{Changelog}
    @sect{0.2.5}
      @ul
        @li
          SBT plugin now formats files in parallel like the CLI.
          If you don't use the SBT plugin, you don't need to upgrade to 0.2.5.

    @sect{0.2.4}
      @ul
        @li
          @lnk("17 issues closed on Github.", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.2.4")
        @li
          @lnk("See diff between 0.2.3 and 0.2.4 on three million lines of code.",
               "https://github.com/olafurpg/scala-repos/pull/1/files#diff-34de65dbb43d071baaf87f34e40e123cL44")
          There are many new changes.
          I recommend you reformat your whole project before upgrading.
          The plan from now on is to release a diff like this for each new release.
        @li
          CLI now formats files in parallel. Formatting a large repo is around 6x
          faster on my machine with 8 virtual cores.
        @li
          Line breaking is now preserved in infix applications. Your pretty DSLs
          should not be ruined by scalafmt anymore.
        @li
          By default, scalafmt now puts a newline before every @code("with") if a class/trait/object
          definition doesn't fit in a single line. Set @code("--binPackParentConstructors true")
          to get the old behavior where scalafmt would fit as many parent constructors
          on a line as possible.
        @li
          For comprehensions, anonymous functions, tuples, var re-assignment,
          default parameter values and named arguments received a lot of
          attention and should look nicer now.
        @li
          Thanks to @user("fthomas"),
          the SBT plugin now uses @code("unmanagedSourceDirectories") instead of
          @code("scalaSource") to decide which files to format.
          This should improve your experience in Scala.js and cross-built projects.
    @sect{0.2.3}
      @p
      @ul
        @li
          @lnk("5 issues closed on Github.", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.2.3")
        @li
          Fixes 3 issues that caused non-idempotent formatting.
          The tests now format 1.244.070 LOC @b("twice") to ensure that
          scalafmt is idempotent.
        @li
          @sect.ref{stripMargin alignment} is now disabled by default for two
          reasons: 1. it may cause non-idempotent formatting in very rare cases
          and 2. it makes the false assumption that
          @code("stripMargin") comes from the standard library (discussion here @issues(170)).
          Refer to @sect.ref{stripMargin alignment} to enable it at your own risk.
        @li
          IntelliJ plugin does not require restart when @code(".scalafmt") changes.
          Instead, new changes are picked up automatically and a green info bubble
          pops up.
    @sect{0.2.2}

      @p
        @note. This release contains a bug, see @issue(192).
        Please hold off from upgrading.

      @p
        This release changes the formatting rules for many small cases.

          Token alignment, see @sect.ref{Token alignment}
        @li
          Closed issues: @issues( 144, 143, 138, 131, 120, 114).
        @li
          @code("ScalaFmt") was renamed to @code("Scalafmt").
        @li
          The @code("scalafmtFormat") sbt task is now @code("scalafmt").
        @li
          @code("ScalaStyle") is now @code("ScalafmtStyle").
        @li
          @code("ScalaFmt.format") and
          @code("ScalaFmt.format_!") have been replaced by a single
          @code("Scalafmt.format"). The new methods supports more flexibility
          via the @lnk("ScalafmtRunner", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/555e87cabb3caf313a5915ac6506f9a79a84457c/core/src/main/scala/org/scalafmt/ScalafmtRunner.scala")
          argument.

    @sect{0.1.6}
      @ul
        @li
          Scalafmt will not hang anymore, not even for
          @lnk("deeply nested computer generated code", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/124134dcd6a6c45d398d713ade266e071f4dc73c/core/src/test/scala/org/scalafmt/PathologicalCasesTest.scala#L13").
          When scalafmt detects it's struggling to format a statement,
          it falls back to heuristics that return decent, but suboptimal, formatting
          output. If the heuristics still fail, scalafmt falls back to the
          original formatting of the code up until the next statement.
        @li
          Spark, Akka and the IntelliJ Scala Plugin have been added to the
          test suite, which now runs on a total of 9.398 files from external
          projects. That's almost 8.000 more files than in 0.1.5! Some key
          statistics from formatting all 9.398 files:

          @table
            @thead
              @tr
                @th
                  Computer
                @th
                  75th percentile

                  Average
                @th
                  Max
            @tbody
              @tr
                @td
                  2.5 GHz i7 Macbook Pro

                @td
                  112ms
                @td
                  7.1s
              @tr
                @td
                  Travis CI (for fun)
                @td

                @td

                @td
                  45.2s

          @p
            There is still a lot of work to do. The plan is to investigate
            the 90+ percentile cases in future releases as well as run
            more JMH benchmarks.

        @li
          For loops can now have multiple if guards in a row. For example:
          @example
            object ForLoopGuards {
              for {
                x <- List(1, 2, 3)
                if (x != 1)
                if (x != 3)
              } yield x
            }
        @li
          Fixed bugs where a newline would come after return keyword.
        @li
          Fixed bugs where scalafmt would crash on the following if it exceeded
          the column limit.

          @hl.scala
            new Foo with Bar with Kaz {}
        @li
          Scalafmt no longer crashes when xml literal are used in infix
          applications.
        @li
          Minor changes to select statement formatting.

    @sect{0.1.5}
      @ul
        @li
          Select chains are kept on a single line if they fit up to the last
          opening curly brace.

          @hl.scala
            // column          |
            // before
            List(1)
              .map { x =>
                x + 1
              }
            // after
            List(1).map { x =>
              x + 1
            }
        @li
          Really long sequences of infix applications (for example, string
          concatenations) don't hog anymore.
        @li
          Various small bug and speed improvements.
          For example, all files in
          @lnk("Fastparse", "https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse/"),
          @lnk("Scalding", "https://github.com/twitter/scalding") and
          @lnk("Goose", "https://github.com/GravityLabs/goose") that had
          problems with 0.1.4 format without issues on 0.1.5.
        @li
          Ramped up testing.
          Fastparse, Scalding and Goose
          have been added to the test suite, which now runs on 1405 files
          from external projects.
          The plan is to reach around 28.000 files in the coming 0.1.x releases,
          by including projects like
          @lnk("spark", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/133"),
          @lnk("akka", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/134") and
          @lnk("intellij-scala", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/135").
        @li
          Made rather large internal refactorings, which shouldn't affect
          you as a user.

          @lnk("Array assignments are treated like regular call-site applications", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/122").
        @li
          Commented out code remains un-indented (lines that start with
          @code("//") stay at indentation 0).
        @li
          Blank lines are only forced before top-level definitions and methods
          with docstrings.

    @sect{0.1.2}

      @ul
        @li
          Closed @lnk("17 formatting issues", "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Asjrd+created%3A%3C2016-03-10").
          Thank you Sebastian!
        @li
          Added Java 6+7 compatibility, was Java 8 before.
